* **Introduction:**
Next.js is a popular React-based web framework that simplifies server-side rendering(SSR) for React applications. It helps to build fast and scalable applications with the ability to pre-render pages on the server-side. One of the most significant features of Next.js is Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Next.js provides a feature called Server Side Rendering (SSR), which can be used to render components on the server-side. In this blog, we will learn about implementing server-side props in Next.js and fetching APIs. We will also compare the same with React and useEffect.

* **Server-Side Rendering:**
Server-Side Rendering(SSR) is the process of rendering the React application on the server and sending it to the client-side as a fully rendered HTML page. When the server receives a request, it returns a complete HTML page that includes the rendered React components. This process makes the application load faster and improves SEO optimization.

* **Implementing Server-Side Props in Next.js:**
In Next.js, we can implement server-side props using the getServerSideProps function. This function is executed on the server-side and can fetch data from external APIs or databases. Here's how to use it.
